Hi there! My name is Madeline Yeh, and I am a senior studying Information Science (Data Science and Information Ethics, Law and Policy) at Cornell University. I created this website for a final project in INFO 4260, Computing on Earth: Planetary Dimensions and Consequence of Computing taught by Professor Steve Jackson in Spring 2024. Beyond this class, I am interested in sustainability within tech, and specifically, the applications of data science in improving sustainability efforts and sustainable technologies. Following my graduation from Cornell in Spring 2024, I will be joining Thermo Fisher Scientific as an Associate Data Scientist in the Digital Leadership Development Program.
