title: About E-Waste Calculator

The rapid turnover of hardware technologies, driven by consumer demand and the industry's push for innovation has led to significant environmental consequences. E-Waste is just one of the many physical consequences of computing, and the environmental impact of the frequent upgrading and replacement of technology has not been emphasized enough in the tech innovation conversation. 

As a student studying the environmental impacts of e-waste and geo-political, economic and cultural conflicts that deepen the severity of this issue, I find that it is imperative to equip people with the information and understanding necessary to take action, whether that be on an individual, industrial, or systemic level.

Hi there! My name is [Madeline Yeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madelineyeh/), and I am a senior studying Information Science (Data Science and Information Ethics, Law and Policy) at Cornell University. I created this website for a final project in INFO 4260, Computing on Earth: Planetary Dimensions and Consequence of Computing taught by [Professor Steve Jackson](https://sjackson.infosci.cornell.edu) in Spring 2024. Beyond this class, I am interested in sustainability within tech, and specifically, the applications of data science in improving sustainability efforts and sustainable technologies. Following my graduation from Cornell in Spring 2024, I will be joining Thermo Fisher Scientific as an Associate Data Scientist in the Digital Leadership Development Program.
