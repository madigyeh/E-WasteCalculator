Hi there! My name is Madeline and I'm a student studying Information Science at Cornell University with interests in Data Science and Sustainability. 

I'm an undergraduate at Cornell University graduating in 2024 with a B.A. in Information Science with concentrations in Data Science and Information Ethics, Law, and Policy. I am excited to explore sustainability within the technology industry, and applications of data science to sustainable innovation. 

### What is the E-Waste Calculator?

I created this website for a final project in INFO 4260, Computing on Earth: Planetary Dimensions and Consequence of Computing taught by Professor Steve Jackson.
