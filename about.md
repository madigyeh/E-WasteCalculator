The rapid turnover of hardware technologies, driven by consumer demand and the industry's push for innovation has led to significant environmental consequences. E-Waste is just one of the many physical consequences of computing, and the environmental impact of the frequent upgrading and replacement of technology has not been emphasized enough in the tech innovation conversation. 

As a student studying the environmental impacts of e-waste and geo-political, economic and cultural conflicts that deepen the severity of this issue, I find that it is imperative to equip people with the information and understanding necessary to take action, whether that be on an individual, industrial, or systemic level.
