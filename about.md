Technological advancement has occurred at exponential rates with proprietary hardware technologies being rapidly released in decreasing time intervals. Since the conception of the iPhone, Apple has released a new iPhone model, with several variations, every year since. A similar trend has followed for other appliances, including cameras, household appliances, and computers just to name a few. These advanced technologies have made life more efficient for many of its owners, but the environmental impact of the frequent upgrading and replacement of hardware technologies has not been emphasized enough in the conversation. 

As a student currently studying these environmental impacts and the additional geo-political, economic and cultural influences that deepen the severity of this issue, I find that it is important to equip people with the information and understanding necessary to take action, whether that be on an individual, industrial, or systemic level.

Hi there! My name is [Madeline Yeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madelineyeh/), and I am a senior studying Information Science (Data Science and Information Ethics, Law and Policy) at Cornell University. I created this website for a final project in INFO 4260, Computing on Earth: Planetary Dimensions and Consequence of Computing taught by [Professor Steve Jackson](https://sjackson.infosci.cornell.edu) in Spring 2024. Beyond this class, I am interested in sustainability within tech, and specifically, the applications of data science in improving sustainability efforts and sustainable technologies. Following my graduation from Cornell in Spring 2024, I will be joining Thermo Fisher Scientific as an Associate Data Scientist in the Digital Leadership Development Program.
