### My name is Madeline Yeh. 

I'm an undergraduate at Cornell University graduating in 2024 with a B.A. in Information Science. I am concentrating in Data Science and Information Ethics, Law, and Policy and am excited to explore sustainability efforts within the technology industry, and applications of data science to sustainability innovation.
