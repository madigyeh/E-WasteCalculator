          <h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
          <p>The right to repair matters, because it empowers consumers, supports local economies, and contributes to a more sustainable and just technological landscape. When consumers have the right to repair, they have the independence to fix their own devices and this simultaneously drives down the price of self repair and repair services. By advocating for the right to repair, we can build a future where products are designed to last, resources are conserved, and consumers have greater control over the devices they own.</p>
